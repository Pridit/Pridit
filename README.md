### Hi 👋

I'm **Jordan**, a professional self-taught full-stack web app developer. I have been employed in tech for over **5 years** enhancing businesses with modern, forward thinking solutions.

Predominantly working with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), and before that [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/). More recently, [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/).

I've been messing with code since my early teens, solving problems as well as volunteering closely with communities such as [PCGamingWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCGamingWiki) to build solutions.
