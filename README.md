### Hi, I'm Jordan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a British, UK based self-taught full-stack web developer (PHP), enthusiast in infrastructure (Docker, AWS), and motorsports enjoyer (F1).

### Work ðŸ’»

After starting my career building with [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/), I quickly moved onto [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). More recently I have taken an interest in [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/). I've worked with start-ups and medium sized businesses, both on-site and remote.

### Volunteer ðŸ«¶

I spent a few years volunteering closely with [PCGamingWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCGamingWiki). As a site administrator my typical day-to-day encompassed everything from community management to liaising with game publishers.

### Contact ðŸ’¬
