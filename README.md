# Hi 👋

I'm **Jordan**, a professional self-taught full-stack web app developer. I have been employed in tech for over **5 years** enhancing businesses with modern, forward thinking solutions.

I've been messing with code since my early teens, solving problems as well as volunteering closely with communities such as [PCGamingWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCGamingWiki) (we even met up during EGX Rezzed 2015!)
