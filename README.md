### Hi 👋

I'm **Jordan**, a self-taught full-stack web app developer and keen enthusiast in tech.

Primarily building with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), and before that [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/). More recently I have taken an interest in [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Astro](https://astro.build/).

I started messing with code in my early teens, solving problems and eventually volunteering closely with communities such as [PCGamingWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCGamingWiki).
